# How to Get Your Solana Private Key

This guide explains how to safely obtain and use your Solana private key with the trading bot.

## Important Security Warning

Your private key provides full access to your wallet. Never share it with anyone, and be extremely careful when using it in any application.

## Option 1: Using Phantom Wallet (Recommended)

1. Open your Phantom wallet browser extension
2. Click the gear icon in the bottom right to access Settings
3. Select "Security & Privacy"
4. Click "Show Secret Recovery Phrase"
5. Enter your password when prompted
6. Your secret recovery phrase will be displayed
7. Use this phrase with the bot's "Import from seed phrase" option in Settings

## Option 2: Using Solflare Wallet

1. Open your Solflare wallet
2. Click the three dots in the top right corner
3. Select "Export Private Key"
4. Enter your password when prompted
5. Copy the private key
6. Paste it into the bot's private key field in Settings

## Option 3: Creating a New Wallet for Trading

If you prefer to use a separate wallet for trading:

1. In the bot's Settings tab, click "Generate New Wallet"
2. The bot will create a new Solana wallet and display the private key
3. Save this private key securely
4. Send SOL and funds to the new wallet address displayed
5. Use this wallet exclusively for trading

## Securing Your Private Key

The bot stores your private key locally in an encrypted format. However, for maximum security:

1. Use a dedicated trading wallet with limited funds
2. Never store your main wallet's private key on your computer
3. Consider using a hardware wallet for your main funds
4. Regularly check for unauthorized transactions

## Testing the Connection

After entering your private key:

1. Go to the Settings tab
2. Click "Test Connection"
3. The bot will verify that it can connect to your wallet
4. If successful, you'll see your wallet balance displayed

Remember: The bot requires your private key to execute trades on your behalf, but it never transmits this key over the internet.
